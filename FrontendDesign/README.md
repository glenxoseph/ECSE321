However, Myriad is not a web safe font.
As a result, a similar font PT Sans will be applied as a substitution.

### Logo
The logo illustrates 2 people communicating, 1 student and 1 tutor. This is the most iconic service of our company.
The logo comes in two colors, 1 blue version and 1 white version.
